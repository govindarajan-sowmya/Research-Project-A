# Research-Project-A
This project is mainly about findings of sentimrntal analysis using Traditional machine learning algorithms and Deep learning algorithms.
Techniques such as Count Vectorizer and Doc2Vec is used to change the text to vector representation.
Review code- This code consistes of data that is subjected to Machine learning algorithms using Count Vectorizer. The algorithms used are 

a) Random Forest- 84% accuracy
b) Logistic regression- 85% accuracy
c) Naive bayes- 82% accuracy
d) Decision tree- 77% accuracy
e) K Nearest Neighbors- 67% accuracy

Text blob and vader package is used to find the sentimental analysis.A validation curve has been drawn to see the results.
Doc2vec code consists of code that has Used Doc2vec features to change the whole document to vector. It has achieved a accuracy of 82 percent.
LSTM model was implemented and code is in LSTM code and it has used pad_sequences to truncate the data for equal length and it has also achieved good accuracy of 81 %.
