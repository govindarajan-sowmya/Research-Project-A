# Research-Project-A
This project is mainly about findings of sentimrntal analysis using Traditional machine learning algorithms and Deep learning algorithms.
Techniques such as Count Vectorizer and Doc2Vec is used to change the text to vector representation.
Review code- This code consistes of data that is subjected to Machine learning algorithms using Count Vectorizer. The algorithms used are 
a) Random Forest
b) Logistic regression
c) Naive bayes
d) Decision tree
e) K Nearest Neighbors
Text blob and vader package is used to find the sentimental analysis.A validation curve has been drawn to see the results.
